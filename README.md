### 1. File I/O

In this section, you'll learn how to work with files in Python, including opening, closing, reading, writing, seeking, and handling exceptions.

### 2. NumPy Basics

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. In this section, you'll learn about array creation, basic operations, indexing, slicing, shape manipulation, stacking, and splitting of arrays using NumPy.

### 3. Pandas: Importing and Data Preparation

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. In this section, you'll learn how to import data from various formats (CSV, Excel, text, etc.) using pandas data frames and prepare the data for analysis.

### 4. Pandas: Data Filtering and Sorting

Continuing with Pandas, you'll explore data filtering and sorting techniques to extract valuable information from the data.

### 5. Matplotlib: Simple Interactive Charts

Matplotlib is a popular library for data visualization in Python. In this section, you'll understand how to create simple interactive charts, including line charts, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.

### 6. Matplotlib: Subplots, Multiple Figures, and Customizations

Building on the previous section, you'll learn how to work with subplots, multiple figures, and customize your charts with text, grids, and legends. Additionally, you'll learn how to save the charts for later use.

### 7. Seaborn: Visualizing Statistical Relationships

Seaborn is a powerful library for statistical data visualization. In this section, you'll explore various techniques to visualize statistical relationships between data points.

### 8. Seaborn: Plotting with Categorical Data and Linear Relationships

Continuing with Seaborn, you'll learn how to plot categorical data and visualize linear relationships effectively.

### 9. Data Pre-processing Methods

Data pre-processing is a critical step in data analysis. In this section, you'll learn different data pre-processing techniques to clean and transform data for further analysis.

### 10. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values

Missing data is a common issue in datasets. You'll learn various techniques to handle missing values, including cleaning, filling, dropping, and replacing missing data.

### 11. Exploratory Analysis: Clustering Techniques

In this section, you'll develop k-means and MST-based clustering techniques and learn how to assess clusters for a given dataset.

### 12. Basic Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis is fundamental in data science. You'll perform basic statistical analysis by calculating measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and explore probability and sampling distributions.

**Note:** The topics listed above represent the content planned for the Data Analytics Lab. The README will be updated as the course progresses, providing more detailed information and resources for each section.
