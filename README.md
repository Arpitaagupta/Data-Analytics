### 1. Introduction to NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and an assortment of functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. In this section, you'll learn about the basic concepts of NumPy and its advantages over standard Python lists.

### 2. Array Creation

In this section, you'll explore various ways to create NumPy arrays. We'll cover different functions for creating arrays from scratch, generating arrays with evenly spaced values, and more. Understanding how to create arrays is the foundation for working with NumPy.

### 3. Basic Operations

NumPy offers a wide range of mathematical operations on arrays. In this section, you'll learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations, element-wise operations, and broadcasting. These operations are essential for any data manipulation and analysis using NumPy.

### 4. Indexing and Slicing

Indexing and slicing allow you to access specific elements or subsets of an array. In this section, you'll learn different techniques to access and modify array elements using various indexing methods, including boolean indexing and fancy indexing.

### 5. Shape Manipulation

NumPy provides functions to change the shape of arrays, such as reshaping, flattening, and transposing. Understanding how to manipulate the shape of arrays is essential for data preprocessing and transforming data for further analysis.

### 6. Stacking and Splitting

In this section, you'll learn how to combine multiple arrays to create larger arrays (stacking) and split arrays into smaller parts. These techniques are useful when you need to merge data from different sources or divide data for parallel processing.

Each section in the repository will contain code examples, explanations, and exercises to solidify your understanding of the topics covered. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the examples provided.

Happy coding!
